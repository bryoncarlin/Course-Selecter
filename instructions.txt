I have included two video files showing the program working in motion.

I used React to create this program, using npm packages. To start the program please use npm start on the App.js file for the webpage

For the server side please go to index.js in the server folder and do the same "npm start"

If you are having any issues running it please email me at bryon.carlin@outlook.com
